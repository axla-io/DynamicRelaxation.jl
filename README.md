# DynamicRelaxation.jl

A differentiable Julia implementation of the Dynamic Relaxation method to find the equilibrium shape of nonlinear structures.

## Features

* Uses `DifferentialEquations.jl` solvers to solve for the equilibrium shape
* Define the structural system with `StaticGraphs`
* Optimize your structure with differentiable programming.
